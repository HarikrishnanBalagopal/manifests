With IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service, you can create a cluster from the following infrastructure providers:
- Classic Inffrastructure: A classic compute, networking, and storage environment in IBM Cloud infrastructure.
- Virtual Private Cloud(VPC): A next generation of IBM Cloud infrastructure virtual servers in your own Virtual Private Cloud.

Once the Kubernetes Service is up and running, you can start your Kubeflow deployment.
